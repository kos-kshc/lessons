					Heinrich Harrer (German: [ˈhaɪnʁɪç ˈhaʁɐ]; 6 July 1912 – 7 January 2006) was an Austrian mountaineer,
					sportsman, geographer, Oberscharführer in the Schutzstaffel (SS), and author. He was a member of the
					four-man climbing team that made the first ascent of the North Face of the Eiger, the "last problem" of
					the Alps. He wrote the books Seven Years in Tibet (1952) and The White Spider (1959).

				<p>
					Heinrich Harrer was born 6 July 1912 in Hüttenberg, Austria, in the district of Sankt Veit an der Glan in
					the state of Carinthia. His father, Josef Harrer, was a postal worker. From 1933 to 1938, Harrer studied
					geography and sports at the Karl-Franzens University in Graz. Harrer became a member of the traditional
					student corporation ATV Graz.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1935, Harrer was designated to participate in the Alpine skiing competition at the 1936 Winter
					Olympics in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The Austrian Alpine skiing team, however, boycotted the event due to
					a conflict regarding the skiing instructors' status as professionals. As a result, Harrer did not
					participate.
					<br>
					In 1937, Harrer won the downhill event at the World Student Championships at Zell am See.

				<p>
					Mountain climbing was Harrer's true passion. Knowing an extraordinary feat of climbing could win him a
					place on a Himalayan expedition, Harrer and a friend, Fritz Kasparek, resolved to be the first to climb
					the North Face of the Eiger (3,967 m, 13,025 ft) in Switzerland. The near vertical wall, with its
					ice-field known as The White Spider, had claimed several lives; and the Bernese authorities even banned
					climbing it. Following his final university exams in July 1938, Harrer and Kasparek traveled to Kleine
					Scheidegg at the foot of the Eiger and set out on their climb. Halfway up the mountain, Harrer and
					Kasparek encountered another team making the attempt, Ludwig Vörg and Anderl Heckmair from Germany. The
					four decided to make the rest of the climb as a single team, with the experienced Heckmair leading.[2]
				</p>
				<p>
					Throughout the climb, the four men were constantly threatened by snow avalanches and rock falls. They
					were caught in an avalanche as they climbed the White Spider on the upper face, but all possessed
					sufficient strength to resist being swept off the face. The members successfully reached the summit at
					four o'clock in the afternoon 24 July 1938.[3] This first ascent of the Eiger North Face was described by
					Italian climber Reinhold Messner as "a glorious moment in the history of mountaineering and a great
					sensation, since several climbers had previously perished on the Face",[4] made headlines around the
					world,[5] and is recounted in Harrer's book The White Spider, published in 1959.

				<p id="nazi" class="section-name">Nazi involvement</p>
				<p>
					In 1996, ORF editor and filmmaker Gerald Lehner found in American archives the membership card of Harrer,
					who joined the Sturmabteilung (SA) in October 1933. After the Anschluss of March 1938, as Germany annexed
					Austria, he joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) on 1 April. He held the rank of Oberscharführer (Sergeant), and
					on
					1 May he became a member of the Nazi Party. After their ascent of the Eiger North Face, the four climbers
					were received by and photographed with Adolf Hitler. Harrer later said he wore his SS uniform only once,
					on
					the day of his marriage to Charlotte Wegener, daughter of the eminent explorer and scholar Alfred
					Wegener.[1] After returning to Europe in 1952, Harrer was cleared of any pre-war crimes and this was
					later
					supported by Simon Wiesenthal.[2] In his memoir, Beyond Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer called his
					involvement
					with the Nazi Party a mistake made in his youth, when he had not yet learned to think for himself.

				<p>
					In 1939, Harrer joined a four-man expedition, led by Peter Aufschnaiter, to the Diamir Face of the Nanga
					Parbat with the aim of finding an easier route to the peak. Having concluded that the face was viable,
					the
					four mountaineers were in Karachi, India at the end of August, waiting for a freighter to take them home.
					The ship being long overdue, Harrer, Ludwig, and Hans Lobenhoffer tried to reach Persia (Iran), but
					several
					hundred kilometres north-west of Karachi they were arrested by British soldiers as enemy aliens and
					escorted
					back to Karachi, where Aufschnaiter had stayed. Two days later, war was declared, and on 3 September 1939
					all were put behind barbed wire to be transferred to a detention camp at Ahmednagar near Bombay. They
					considered escaping to Portuguese Goa, but when further transferred to Dehradun to be detained there for
					years with 1,000 other enemy aliens, they found Tibet more promising, the final goal being the Japanese
					front in Burma or China.
				</p>
				<p>
					Aufschnaiter and Harrer escaped and were re-captured a number of times before finally succeeding. On 29
					April 1944, Harrer and six others, including Rolf Magener and Heins von Have (disguised as British
					officers), Aufschnaiter, the Salzburger Bruno Treipel (aka Treipl) and the Berliners Hans Kopp and
					Sattler
					(disguised as native Indian workers), walked out of the camp. Magener and von Have took the train to
					Calcutta and from there found their way to the Japanese army in Burma.[7][8]
				</p>
				<p>
					The others headed for the closest border via Landour. After Sattler gave up on 10 May, the remaining four
					entered Tibet on 17 May 1944, crossing the Tsang Chok-la Pass (5,896 m, 19,350 ft) and thereafter split
					into
					two groups: Harrer and Kopp, Aufschnaiter and Treipel. On 17 June, Treipel, exhausted, bought himself a
					horse and rode back to the lowlands. Several months later, when the remaining three were still without
					visas
					for Tibet, Kopp also gave up and left for Nepal (where he was handed over to the British authorities
					within
					a few days).

				<p>
					Aufschnaiter and Harrer, helped by the former's knowledge of the Tibetan language, proceeded to Tibet's
					capital city, Lhasa, which they reached on 15 January 1946 (eight months after Nazi Germany's surrender),
					having crossed Western Tibet, the South-West with Gyirong County, and the Northern Changthang.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1948, Harrer became a salaried official of the Tibetan government, translating foreign news and acting
					as the Court photographer. Harrer first met the 14th Dalai Lama when he was summoned to the Potala Palace
					and asked to make a film about ice skating, which Harrer had introduced to Tibet.[8] Harrer built a
					cinema for him, with a projector run off a Jeep engine. Harrer soon became the Dalai Lama's tutor in
					English, geography, and some science, and Harrer was astonished at how fast his pupil absorbed the
					Western world's knowledge.[8] They shared the same birthday and a strong friendship developed between the
					two that would last the rest of Harrer's life.[10]
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1952, Harrer returned to Austria where he documented his experiences in the books Seven Years in Tibet
					(1952) and Lost Lhasa (1953). Seven Years in Tibet was translated into 53 languages, and was a bestseller
					in the United States in 1954, selling three million copies.[1] The book was the basis of two films of the
					same title, the first in 1956 and the second in 1997, starring Brad Pitt in the role of Harrer.[11]
				</p>
				<p>
					In Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer wrote:
					<br>
					Wherever I live, I shall feel homesick for Tibet. I often think I can still hear the cries of wild geese
					and cranes and the beating of their wings as they fly over Lhasa in the clear, cold moonlight. My
					heartfelt wish is that my story may create some understanding for a people whose will to live in peace
					and freedom has won so little sympathy from an indifferent world.[12]

				<p>
					Following his return from Tibet, Harrer settled down in Kitzbühel, Austria, and later in Liechtenstein.
					He
					took part in a number of ethnographic as well as mountaineering expeditions to Alaska, the Andes, and the
					Mountains of the Moon in central Africa. In 1953 he explored the source of the Amazon River and made a
					first
					ascent of Ausangate (6384 m). In 1954, some with German-American Fred Beckey, Harrer made the first
					ascents
					of Mount Deborah (3,761 m, 12,339 ft), Mount Hunter (4,442 m, 14,573 ft), and Mount Drum (3661 m), all in
					Alaska. In 1957, he explored the Congo River with the former king Leopold III of Belgium.
				</p>
				<p>
					In February 1962, he was the leader of the team of four climbers who made the first ascent of the
					Carstensz
					Pyramid (4,884 m, 16,024 ft; later named Puncak Jaya) on Papua, Indonesia, the highest peak in Oceania
					and
					one of the Seven Summits. This and his pioneering expedition to reach the Neolithic stone axe quarries at
					Ya-Li-Me are recorded in his memoir I Come from the Stone Age.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1966, he met the Xingu Indians of Brazil's Mato Grosso. In 1972, Harrer crossed the island of Borneo.
					He
					also made expeditions to Nepal, French Guiana, Greenland, Sudan, India, Ladakh, Andaman Islands, Uganda,
					Kenya and Bhutan.
				</p>
				<p>
					Harrer wrote more than 20 books about his adventures, some including photographs considered to be among
					the
					best records of traditional Tibetan culture. Harrer was also an excellent golfer, winning Austrian
					national
					championships in 1958 and 1970.

				<p>
					In December 1938, Harrer married Lotte Wegener (1920–1989), the daughter of Alfred Wegener, German polar
					researcher and originator of the theory of continental drift. Her father had died on a Greenland
					expedition when she was 10. Their son Peter Harrer was born in December 1939, three months after Harrer
					had been interned by British forces in India. Their marriage was dissolved in 1943 while he was still in
					India. In 1953, he married Margaretha Truxa (divorce in 1958), and in 1962 he married Katharina (Carina)
					Haarhaus (1922–2014), who remained his wife until his death.

				<p>
					In the early 1980s, he visited Tibet again, and wrote a sequel to Seven Years in Tibet, titled Return to
					Tibet: Tibet After the Chinese Occupation. The Kirkus Review of his sequel said"
				</p>
				<p class="review">
					In 1982 he was able to revisit Tibet during the 'Chinese-staged thaw,' and he was by turns heartbroken
					and inspired by what be observed: Valuable cultural treasures had been destroyed by the invaders, and
					stories of concentration camps, forced labor, and political murders sent him reeling. Yet the country's
					religion was still strong, and there continued both armed resistance to the Chinese and an unquashable
					national will.
				</p>
				<p>
					He later wrote his autobiography published in English as Beyond Seven Years in Tibet in 2007.[10] He made
					approximately 40 documentary films and founded the Heinrich Harrer Museum in Hüttenberg, Austria
					dedicated to Tibet. In October 2002, the Dalai Lama presented Harrer with the International Campaign for
					Tibet's Light of Truth Award for his efforts to bring the situation in Tibet to international
					attention. Harrer died on 7 January 2006 in Friesach, Austria at the age of 93.
