				RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic
				Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New
				York City, United States. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it
				the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an
				ocean liner or cruise ship.[4] The disaster drew public attention, provided foundational material for the
				disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works.
			</p>
			<p>
				RMS Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time she entered service and the second of three
				Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard
				in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, the chief naval architect of the shipyard, died in the disaster.[5] Titanic was
				under the command of Captain Edward Smith, who went down with the ship. The ocean liner carried some of the
				wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland,
				Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.

				The name Titanic derives from the Titans of Greek mythology. Built in Belfast, Ireland, in the United
				Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, RMS Titanic was the second of the three Olympic-class ocean liners—the
				first was RMS Olympic and the third was HMHS Britannic.[7] Britannic was originally to be called Gigantic
				and was to be over 1,000 feet (300 m) long.[8][failed verification] They were by far the largest vessels of
				the British shipping company White Star Line's fleet, which comprised 29 steamers and tenders in 1912.[9]
				The three ships had their genesis in a discussion in mid-1907 between the White Star Line's chairman, J.
				Bruce Ismay, and the American financier J. P. Morgan, who controlled the White Star Line's parent
				corporation, the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMM).

				Titanic was 882 feet 9 inches (269.06 m) long with a maximum breadth of 92 feet 6 inches (28.19 m).
			</p>
			<p>
				Her total height, measured from the base of the keel to the top of the bridge, was 104 feet (32 m).[19] She
				measured 46,329 GRT and 21,831 NRT[20] and with a draught of 34 feet 7 inches (10.54 m), she displaced
				52,310 tons.[7] All three of the Olympic-class ships had ten decks (excluding the top of the officers'
				quarters), eight of which were for passenger use. From top to bottom, the decks were:
			</p>
			<p>
				The Boat Deck, on which the lifeboats were housed. It was from here during the early hours of 15 April 1912
				that Titanic's lifeboats were lowered into the North Atlantic. The bridge and wheelhouse were at the forward
				end, in front of the captain's and officers' quarters. The bridge stood 8 feet (2.4 m) above the deck,
				extending out to either side so that the ship could be controlled while docking. The wheelhouse stood within
				the bridge. The entrance to the First Class Grand Staircase and gymnasium were located midships along with
				the raised roof of the First Class lounge, while at the rear of the deck were the roof of the First Class
				smoke room and the relatively modest Second Class entrance. The wood-covered deck was divided into four
				segregated promenades: for officers, First Class passengers, engineers, and Second Class passengers
				respectively. Lifeboats lined the side of the deck except in the First Class area, where there was a gap so
				that the view would not be spoiled.

					Titanic was equipped with three main engines—two reciprocating four-cylinder, triple-expansion steam
					engines and one centrally placed low-pressure Parsons turbine—each driving a propeller. The two
					reciprocating engines had a combined output of 30,000 horsepower (22,000 kW). The output of the steam
					turbine was 16,000 horsepower (12,000 kW).[19] The White Star Line had used the same combination of
					engines on an earlier liner, Laurentic, where it had been a great success.[32] It provided a good
					combination of performance and speed; reciprocating engines by themselves were not powerful enough to
					propel an Olympic-class liner at the desired speeds, while turbines were sufficiently powerful but caused
					uncomfortable vibrations, a problem that affected the all-turbine Cunard liners Lusitania and
					Mauretania.[33] By combining reciprocating engines with a turbine, fuel usage could be reduced and motive
					power increased, while using the same amount of steam.[34]

				<span id="compartments" class="sections-3">Compartments and funnels</span>
				<p>
					The interiors of the Olympic-class ships were subdivided into 16 primary compartments divided by 15
					bulkheads that extended above the waterline. Eleven vertically closing watertight doors could seal off
					the compartments in the event of an emergency.[47] The ship's exposed decking was made of pine and teak,
					while interior ceilings were covered in painted granulated cork to combat condensation.[48] Standing
					above the decks were four funnels, each painted buff with black tops; only three were functional—the
					aftmost one was a dummy, installed for aesthetic purposes and kitchen ventilation. Two masts, each 155 ft
					(47 m) high, supported derricks for working cargo.
				</p>
				<span id="rudder" class="sections-3">Rudder and steering engines</span>
				<p>
					Titanic's rudder was so large—at 78 feet 8 inches (23.98 m) high and 15 feet 3 inches (4.65 m) long,
					weighing over 100 tons—that it required steering engines to move it. Two steam-powered steering engines
					were installed, though only one was used at any one time, with the other one kept in reserve. They were
					connected to the short tiller through stiff springs, to isolate the steering engines from any shocks in
					heavy seas or during fast changes of direction.[49] As a last resort, the tiller could be moved by ropes
					connected to two steam capstans.[50] The capstans were also used to raise and lower the ship's five
					anchors (one port, one starboard, one in the centreline and two kedging anchors).[50]
				</p>
				<span id="water" class="sections-3">Water, ventilation and heating</span>
				<p>
					The ship was equipped with her own waterworks, capable of heating and pumping water to all parts of the
					vessel via a complex network of pipes and valves. The main water supply was taken aboard while Titanic
					was in port, but in an emergency, the ship could also distil fresh water from seawater, though this was
					not a straightforward process as the distillation plant quickly became clogged by salt deposits. A
					network of insulated ducts conveyed warm air, driven by electric fans, around the ship, and First Class
					cabins were fitted with additional electric heaters.[42]
				</p>
				<span id="radio" class="sections-3">Radio communications</span>
				<p>
					Titanic's radiotelegraph equipment (then known as wireless telegraphy) was leased to the White Star Line
					by the Marconi International Marine Communication Company, which also supplied two of its employees, Jack
					Phillips and Harold Bride, as operators. The service maintained a 24-hour schedule, primarily sending and
					receiving passenger telegrams, but also handling navigation messages including weather reports and ice
					warnings.[51][52][6] The radio room was located on the Boat Deck, in the officers' quarters. A
					soundproofed "Silent Room", next to the operating room, housed loud equipment, including the transmitter

			<div class="pas__facilities">
				<span id="pas_facilities" class="sections-2">PASSENGER FACILITIES</span>
				<p>
					The passenger facilities aboard Titanic aimed to meet the highest standards of luxury. According to
					Titanic's general arrangement plans, the ship could accommodate 833 First Class Passengers, 614 in Second
					Class and 1,006 in Third Class, for a total passenger capacity of 2,453. In addition, her capacity for
					crew members exceeded 900, as most documents of her original configuration have stated that her full
					carrying capacity for both passengers and crew was approximately 3,547. Her interior design was a
					departure from that of other passenger liners, which had typically been decorated in the rather heavy
					style of a manor house or an English country house.[54]
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="mail">
				<span id="mail" class="sections-2">MAIL AND CARGO</span>
				<p>
					Although Titanic was primarily a passenger liner, she also carried a substantial amount of cargo. Her
					designation as a Royal Mail Ship (RMS) indicated that she carried mail under contract with the Royal Mail
					(and also for the United States Post Office Department). For the storage of letters, parcels and specie
					(bullion, coins and other valuables), 26,800 cubic feet (760 m3) of space in her holds was allocated. The
					Sea Post Office on G Deck was manned by five postal clerks (three Americans and two Britons), who worked
					13 hours a day, seven days a week, sorting up to 60,000 items daily.[66]
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="lifeboats">
				<span id="lifeboats" class="sections-2">LIFEBOATS</span>
				<p>
					Like Olympic, Titanic carried a total of 20 lifeboats: 14 standard wooden Harland and Wolff lifeboats
					with a capacity of 65 people each and four Engelhardt "collapsible" (wooden bottom, collapsible canvas
					sides) lifeboats (identified as A to D) with a capacity of 47 people each. In addition, she had two
					emergency cutters with a capacity of 40 people each.[70][f] Olympic carried at least two collapsible
					boats on either side of her number one funnel.[71][72] All of the lifeboats were stowed securely on the
					boat deck and, except for collapsible lifeboats A and B, connected to davits by ropes. Those on the
					starboard side were odd-numbered 1–15 from bow to stern, while those on the port side were even-numbered
					2–16 from bow to stern.[73]

				<p>
					The sheer size of Titanic and her sister ships posed a major engineering challenge for Harland and Wolff;
					no shipbuilder had ever before attempted to construct vessels this size.[78] The ships were constructed
					on Queen's Island, now known as the Titanic Quarter, in Belfast Harbour. Harland and Wolff had to
					demolish three existing slipways and build two new ones, the largest ever constructed up to that time, to
					accommodate both ships.[13] Their construction was facilitated by an enormous gantry built by Sir William
					Arrol & Co., a Scottish firm responsible for the building of the Forth Bridge and London's Tower Bridge.
					The Arrol Gantry stood 228 feet (69 m) high, was 270 feet (82 m) wide and 840 feet (260 m) long, and
					weighed more than 6,000 tons. It accommodated a number of mobile cranes. A separate floating crane,
					capable of lifting 200 tons, was brought in from Germany.[79]

			<div class="sea__trials">
				<span id="sea_trials" class="sections-2">SEA TRIALS</span>
				<p>
					Titanic's sea trials began at 6 am on Tuesday, 2 April 1912, just two days after her fitting out was
					finished and eight days before she was due to leave Southampton on her maiden voyage.[97] The trials were
					delayed for a day due to bad weather, but by Monday morning it was clear and fair.[98] Aboard were 78
					stokers, greasers and firemen, and 41 members of crew. No domestic staff appear to have been aboard.
					Representatives of various companies travelled on Titanic's sea trials, Thomas Andrews and Edward Wilding
					of Harland and Wolff and Harold A. Sanderson of IMM. Bruce Ismay and Lord Pirrie were too ill to attend.
					Jack Phillips and Harold Bride served as radio operators and performed fine-tuning of the Marconi
					equipment. Francis Carruthers, a surveyor from the Board of Trade, was also present to see that
					everything worked and that the ship was fit to carry passengers.

				Both Olympic and Titanic registered Liverpool as their home port. The offices of the White Star Line, as
				well as Cunard, were in Liverpool, and up until the introduction of the Olympic, most British ocean liners
				for both Cunard and White Star, such as Lusitania and Mauretania, sailed from Liverpool followed by a port
				of call in Queenstown, Ireland. Since the company's founding in 1845, a vast majority of their operations
				had taken place from Liverpool. However, in 1907 White Star Line established another service from
				Southampton on England's south coast, which became known as White Star's "Express Service". Southampton had
				many advantages over Liverpool, the first being its proximity to London.[103]

					Titanic had around 885 crew members on board for her maiden voyage.[108] Like other vessels of her time,
					she did not have a permanent crew, and the vast majority of crew members were casual workers who only
					came aboard the ship a few hours before she sailed from Southampton.[109] The process of signing up
					recruits had begun on 23 March and some had been sent to Belfast, where they served as a skeleton crew
					during Titanic's sea trials and passage to England at the start of April.[110]

					709 in Third Class. Of these, 869 (66%) were male and 447 (34%) female. There were 107 children aboard,
					the largest number of whom were in Third Class.[118] The ship was considerably under capacity on her
					maiden voyage, as she could accommodate 2,453 passengers—833 First Class, 614 Second Class, and 1,006
					Third Class.[119]

					Titanic's maiden voyage began on Wednesday, 10 April 1912. Following the embarkation of the crew, the
					passengers began arriving at 9:30 am, when the London and South Western Railway's boat train from London
					Waterloo station reached Southampton Terminus railway station on the quayside, alongside Titanic's
					berth.[125] The large number of Third Class passengers meant they were the first to board, with First and
					Second Class passengers following up to an hour before departure. Stewards showed them to their cabins,
					and First Class passengers were personally greeted by Captain Smith.[126] Third Class passengers were
					inspected for ailments and physical impairments that might lead to their being refused entry to the
					United States – a prospect the White Star Line wished to avoid, as it would have to carry anyone who
					failed the examination back across the Atlantic.[123] In all, 920 passengers boarded Titanic at
					Southampton – 179 First Class, 247 Second Class, and 494 Third Class. Additional passengers were to be
					picked up at Cherbourg and Queenstown.[96]

					Titanic was planned to arrive at New York Pier 59[137] on the morning of 17 April.[138] After leaving
					Queenstown, Titanic followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock,[139] a distance of some 55 nautical
					miles (63 mi; 102 km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860 mi; 3,000 km) along a Great
					Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as "the corner" south-east of
					Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. Titanic sailed only a few hours
					past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177 mi; 1,895 km) to Nantucket Shoals
					Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg.[140] The final leg of the journey would have been
					193 nautical miles (222 mi; 357 km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.[141]

					At 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of
					Titanic and alerted the bridge.[158] First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around
					the obstacle and the engines to be reversed,[159] but it was too late; the starboard side of Titanic
					struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline.[l] The hull was not punctured by the
					iceberg, but rather dented such that the hull's seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in.
					Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed,
					as she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. Titanic began sinking bow-first, with
					water spilling from compartment to compartment as

					RMS Carpathia took three days to reach New York after leaving the scene of the disaster. Her journey was
					slowed by pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas.[183] She was, however, able to pass news to the
					outside world by wireless about what had happened. The initial reports were confusing, leading the
					American press to report erroneously on 15 April that Titanic was being towed to port by SS
					Virginian.[184] Later that day, confirmation came through that Titanic had been lost and that most of her
					passengers and crew had died.[185] The news attracted crowds of people to the White Star Line's offices
					in London, New York, Montreal,[186] Southampton,[187] Liverpool and Belfast.[188] It hit hardest in
					Southampton, whose people suffered the greatest losses from the sinking;[189] four out of every five crew
					members came from this town.[190][o]

					In January 1912, the hulls and equipment of Titanic and Olympic had been insured through Lloyd's of
					London and London Marine Insurance. The total coverage was £1,000,000 (£102,000,000 today) per ship. The
					policy was to be "free from all average" under £150,000, meaning that the insurers would only pay for
					damage in excess of that sum. The premium, negotiated by brokers Willis Faber & Company (now Willis
					Group), was 15 s (75 p) per £100, or £7,500 (£790,000 today) for the term of one year. Lloyd's paid the

					Even before the survivors arrived in New York, investigations were being planned to discover what had

					and the United Kingdom, the former more robustly critical of traditions and practices, and scathing of

						One of the most controversial issues examined by the inquiries was the role played by SS Californian,
						which had been only a few miles from Titanic but had not picked up her distress calls or responded to
						her signal rockets. Californian had warned Titanic by radio of the pack ice (that was the reason
						Californian had stopped for the night) but was rebuked by Titanic's senior wireless operator, Jack

					The number of casualties of the sinking is unclear, due to a number of factors. These include confusion
					over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute,
					and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore
					double-counted on the casualty lists.[232] The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635
					people.[233] The tables below use figures from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.[108]
					While the use of the Marconi wireless system did not achieve the result of bringing a rescue ship to
					Titanic before it sank, the use of wireless did bring Carpathia in time to rescue some of the survivors
					who otherwise would have perished due to exposure.[6]

					Once the massive loss of life became known, White Star Line chartered the cable ship CS Mackay-Bennett
					from Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, to retrieve bodies.[242] Three other Canadian ships followed in the
					search: the cable ship Minia,[243] lighthouse supply ship Montmagny and sealing vessel Algerine.[244]
					Each ship left with embalming supplies, undertakers, and clergy. Of the 333 victims that were eventually

				Titanic was long thought to have sunk in one piece and, over the years, many schemes were put forward for
				raising the wreck. None came to fruition.[253] The fundamental problem was the sheer difficulty of finding
				and reaching a wreck that lies over 12,000 feet (3,700 m) below the surface, in a location where the water
				pressure is over 6,500 pounds per square inch (450 bar).[254] A number of expeditions were mounted to find
				Titanic but it was not until 1 September 1985 that a Franco-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and
				Robert Ballard succeeded.[255][256][257]

					that ships should carry enough lifeboats for all aboard, mandated lifeboat drills would be implemented,
					lifeboat inspections would be conducted, etc. Many of these recommendations were incorporated into the
					International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea passed in 1914.[274] The convention has been
					updated by periodic amendments, with a completely new version adopted in 1974.[275] Signatories to the
					Convention followed up with national legislation to implement the new standards. For example, in Britain,
					new "Rules for Life Saving Appliances" were passed by the Board of Trade on 8 May 1914 and then applied
					at a meeting of British steamship companies in Liverpool in June 1914.[276]

					Titanic has gone down in history as the ship that was called unsinkable.[t] For more than 100 years, she
					has been the inspiration of fiction and non-fiction. She is commemorated by monuments for the dead and by
					museums exhibiting artefacts from the wreck. Just after the sinking, memorial postcards sold in huge
					numbers[281] together with memorabilia ranging from tin candy boxes to plates, whiskey jiggers,[282] and
					even black mourning teddy bears.[283] The sinking inspired many ballads such as "The Titanic".[284]
					Several survivors wrote books about their experiences,[285] but it was not until 1955 that the first
					historically accurate book – A Night to Remember – was published.[286]

						Only recently has the significance of Titanic most notably been given by Northern Ireland where it was
						built by Harland and Wolff in the capital city, Belfast. While the rest of the world embraced the
						glory and tragedy of Titanic, in its birth city, Titanic remained a taboo subject throughout the 20th
						century. The sinking brought tremendous grief and was a blow to the city's pride. Its shipyard was
						also a place many Catholics regarded as hostile.[301] In the latter half of the century, during a
						30-year sectarian conflict, Titanic was a reminder of the lack of civil rights that in part
						contributed towards the Troubles. While the fate of Titanic remained a well-known story within local
						households throughout the 20th century, commercial investment in projects recalling RMS Titanic's
						legacy was modest because of these issues.[302]

				There have been several proposals and studies for a project to build a replica ship based on the Titanic. A
				project by South African businessman Sarel Gaus was abandoned in 2006, and a project by Australian
				businessman Clive Palmer was announced in 2012, known as the Titanic II.
